# 🚀 Sort Scroll & Search (Computer Graphics!) 🚀

This project is a comprehensive showcase of various computer graphics techniques and algorithms, implemented in a user-friendly and interactive manner. It's a great resource for anyone looking to understand these concepts in a practical, visual way.

## 🎯 Features 🎯

Here's what you can expect to find in this project:

1. **Infinity Scrolling of Objects on the Screen** 🔄
   This feature demonstrates how objects can be made to scroll infinitely on the screen. It's a common technique used in many video games and interactive applications.

2. **Finite Scrolling of Objects on the Screen** 🛑
   Unlike infinite scrolling, finite scrolling allows objects to move across the screen only up to a certain point. This feature shows how this can be implemented.

3. **Visualization of Bubble Sort** 🧊
   Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This feature visualizes this process, making it easier to understand.

4. **Visualization of Linear Search & Binary Search** 🔍
   Searching is a fundamental concept in computer science. This feature visualizes both Linear Search (where each element in a list is checked sequentially) and Binary Search (an efficient algorithm that divides the list in half with each step).

I hope you find this project useful and informative! Feel free to contribute and enhance these visualizations. Happy coding! 💻
